# CheckFilePermissions

Simple script that given a username and a starting directory, will check if the given user has any permissions on all the files contained inside the given dir.
It will also show a final output with the number of files processed, and the amount of files where the given user has permissions, and the oposite.

Finally it will save the complete routes of all the files where the user has no permission in the "CheckPermissionsOutput.txt", or any other file we chose to.
